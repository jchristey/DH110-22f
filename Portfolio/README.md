# Compost Near Me

## Jade Christey, DH110 UX+UI design, 2022 Fall 

### Design Statement 
Since becoming a citizen of Westwood and moving off of the UCLA campus, I've found that a lot of Westwood apartment buildings don't provide sufficient means to dispose of compost. In line with the Sustainable Development goal: Sustainable Cities, I'm hoping to propose a platform on which users can find local spaces (community gardens, compost sites, etc) to dispose of their food waste in sustainable ways.

### Research 
I conducted Heuristic Evaluation of IRecycleSmart and LACompost to see the current UX issues of sites related to this topic. Read more about this [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/jchristey/DH110-22f/tree/main/assignment1).
