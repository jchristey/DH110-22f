# Compost Near Me

## Jade Christey, DH110 UX+UI design, 2022 Fall 

### Design Statement 
Since becoming a citizen of Westwood and moving off of the UCLA campus, I've found that a lot of Westwood apartment buildings don't provide sufficient means to dispose of compost. In line with the Sustainable Development goal: Sustainable Cities, I'm hoping to propose a platform on which users can find local spaces (community gardens, compost sites, etc) to dispose of their food waste in sustainable ways.

### Research

| | |
|---|---|
|Heuristic Evaluation |I conducted heuristic evaluation of IRecycleSmart and LACompost to see the current UX issues of sites related to this topic. Read more about this [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/jchristey/DH110-22f/tree/main/assignment1).|
|Usability Test |I also conducted usability testing with the IRecycleSmart site. In my heuristic evaluation I found that the site could use some improvement in terms of user control and freedom and flexibility and efficiency of use. Because of this, in this specific UT I wanted to observe how the user found less prominent features of the site, such as the "grass clippings" section, the drop-off mandated items section and the locator associated, and the city lookup function, in order to complete tasks related to finding what they can recycle and how to do so.

|User Research |I also conducted user research with target users. I'm particularly curious as to the process of composting on campus. I narrowed down a student initiative on campus which encourages students to get involved in gardening; the initiative is called DigUCLA. The garden located in Sunset Rec hosts weekly gardening workshops, welcomes gardeners of all experience levels and all the produce grown is donated to the CPO Food Closet.

### Design

| | |
|---|---|
|User Personas|I made two user personas to represent the target users of this app. Through this storytelling process I was able to create target users that are similar in geographic area (on and around college campuses) and age and education level (current college students), yet differ in their level of engagment with environmental issues and involvement within university composting initiatives. Thanks to this, I was able to create a more distinct picture of who is using which different features of the app and how best to design processes that are clear to these specific sets of users. Read more about these [user personas](https://github.com/jchristey/DH110-22f/blob/main/UserPersonas/README.md).|
|Interface Design|I've also established some design iterations of this app. For this portion of the design process I've taken the 'login page' of the app as I believe it will set the tone for how the user will interact with the app as a whole. It is a portion of the site that both the novice user and the expert user would have to initially come into contact with, so it seems to be the perfect page to use as a basis for the interface design of the entire app. Read more about the [interface design](https://github.com/jchristey/DH110-22f/blob/main/InterfaceDesignSystem/README.md)|
|Low Fidelity Prototype|I made a low fidelity prototype in order to troubleshoot interaction issues. Read more about the [low fidelity prototype](https://github.com/jchristey/DH110-22f/blob/main/LowFidelityProto/README.md).|
|High Fidelity Prototype|After troubleshooting and reworking the low fidelity prototype's interactions based on usability testing and adding in interface design elements, I made a [high fidelity prototype](https://github.com/jchristey/DH110-22f/blob/main/HighFidelityPrototype/README.md).|


### Evaluation 

Throughout the design process I continuously conducted user testing to gain valuable feedback. Luckily the target users for this app were college students so I was easily able to survey my roommates and classmates. After the cognitive walkthrough with my classmates I conducted two usabilty tests with users from the target user demographic. 

Linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WOAuXySPIomjBzXY3a8luFIbq9x1qSMx?usp=share_link) are the video recordings of the usability tests. 

I learned some very important things from these tests, allowing me to better my final product. 

The first one I administered shed some light on the interactions between pages. While editing some components based off of the notes from the cognitive walkthrough some of the interactions had been mixed and thus led to the worng pages, I was able to take a closer look at these and fix them to make the flow more logical. 

After having made these edits I conducted the second usability test which illuminated a further need to distiguish between the 'Host a garden' and 'Find gardens near me' buttons. For this test I had to direct the user back to these options and put specific focus on which one she should chose for which task. After the usability test the user did say that she felt she was too hasty and that's why she missed these. I did however adjust the color of the information button to further encourage the user to use it to gain further information. Other than this the user was able to quickly find all other functions.
