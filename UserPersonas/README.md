### UX Storytelling 

The purpose of creating these personas and user scenarios is to put the researcher and designer in the shoes of users who may have varied desires and intentions in using the app. By using insights from contextual interviews and other steps of this process I was able to develop believable users of the app. Through this storytelling process I was able to create target users that are similar in geographic area (on and around college campuses) and age and education level (current college students), yet differ in their level of engagment with environmental issues and involvement within university composting initiatives. Thanks to this, I was able to create a more distinct picture of who is using which different features of the app and how best to design processes that are clear to these specific sets of users. 

### Tasks

#### 1: Create a garden profile

Community and campus garden representatives will be able to establish profiles which other users can interact with and join. The founder or 'host' sets the profile with relevant information and location. 

#### 2: Find your local garden 

More novice users can use the app to quickly search for gardens on their campuses (or nearby) and the services they provide in order to schedule a pick up  or find a drop off location for their food scraps. 

### User Personas and Scenarios

These two user personas will inform the design of the app from two ends of the spectrum. We have Rebecca who is more involved in enviornmental activism, using the platform as a means of publicity for her existing garden as a 'host' on the platform. While novice, Matt, is simply looking for an easy solution as to where to put his food scraps, making him a 'searcher'. 

### Personas and Empathy Maps

Below our personas: Matt and Rebecca are shown with their demographic information, brief personal bios as well as their motivations, goals, and challenges. 

#### Meet Rebecca - a passionate enviornmentalist

### Scenarios and Journey Maps

The scenarios outlined in these journeys represent tasks to take place both for those with a role in establishing profiles for community gardens on the app and those simply searching for a quick fix as to where to put their food scraps. 

#### Rebecca's Scenario

Rebecca is having trouble recruiting people for her community garden. Whenever she mentions it in classes or to friends they seem interested but they say that they’re unable to find reliable and updated information online about the garden. She’s tried pushing the garden and their mission on social media but is unable to gain any sort of engaged following. In her research she stumbled upon the “Compost Near Me” app and saw how other communities have already started pages for their gardens and are able to post blog updates and message potential composters. She downloaded the app and was able to create an account within minutes, adding photos, sending invites to her fellow gardeners to join as collaborators, and drafting blog posts. Within days she was able to gain traction, with multiple students in the area messaging her to schedule compost drop offs and some even messaging to ask for volunteer opportunities in the garden.

#### Matt's Scenario

Matt comes from a “reuse, reduce, recycle” family, he does his best to save containers and plastic bags to reuse where applicable. However, since coming to college he’s found that compost isn’t super accessible. His apartment building doesn’t have a composting system so he’s been throwing his food scraps in the trash. He didn’t think much of it until some of his friends were chatting one day and they all realized how bad it was that they no longer had a system in place that allowed them to compost. This pushed him to do some research to see if there was anywhere near him where he could drop off food scraps and have it positively impact the environment. After a quick search he finds the ‘Compost Near Me’ app and quickly makes a profile, finds his local garden and sees they have a drop off location just minutes walk away from his apartment. He sends them a message to let them know that he’ll be dropping off his scraps at the end of the week.

### Reflection

When creating these user personas I attempted to incorporate some motivations and mentalities I obersved during the contextual interview phase. 

##### In Matt's case: 
During my contextual interview I found that college students make decisions largely based on ease of use and price (with the expectation that a service be as close to free as possible). 

##### In Rebecca's case: 
From discussion in class I found that my other classmates working on the Sustainable Cities project found that more invested environmentalists were often interested in connecting with others with a similar mindset. 

Because of these two perceived needs I wanted the app to cater to both of their needs, with the seperation of 'hosts' and 'searchers'. With different expectations as to the commitment level of each of these users. Users like Rebecca would use the application more frequentlyt and invest more time in creating profile spaces, whereas users like Matt can casually scroll once or twice to find what they need and may only return if they want to become more involved in local/campus gardening and compost efforts.
