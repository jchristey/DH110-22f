### UX Storytelling 

The purpose of creating these personas and user scenarios is to put the researcher and designer in the shoes of users who may have varied desires and intentions in using the app. By using insights from contextual interviews and other steps of this process I was able to develop believable users of the app. Through this storytelling process I was able to create target users that are similar in geographic area (on and around college campuses) and age and education level (current college students), yet differ in their level of engagment with environmental issues and involvement within university composting initiatives. Thanks to this, I was able to create a more distinct picture of who is using which different features of the app and how best to design processes that are clear to these specific sets of users. 

### Tasks

#### 1: Create a garden profile

Community and campus garden representatives will be able to establish profiles which other users can interact with and join. The founder or 'host' sets the profile with relevant information and location. 

#### 2: Find your local garden 

More novice users can use the app to quickly search for gardens on their campuses (or nearby) and the services they provide in order to schedule a pick up  or find a drop off location for their food scraps. 

### User Personas and Scenarios

These two user personas will inform the design of the app from two ends of the spectrum. We have Rebecca who is more involved in enviornmental activism, using the platform as a means of publicity for her existing garden as a 'host' on the platform. While novice, Matt, is simply looking for an easy solution as to where to put his food scraps, making him a 'searcher'. 

### Personas and Empathy Maps

Below our personas: Matt and Rebecca are shown with their demographic information, brief personal bios as well as their motivations, goals, and challenges. 

#### Meet Rebecca - a passionate enviornmentalist

### Scenarios and Journey Maps

The scenarios outlined in these journeys represent tasks to take place both for those with a role in establishing profiles for community gardens on the app and those simply searching for a quick fix as to where to put their food scraps.

### Reflection

When creating these user personas I attempted to incorporate some motivations and mentalities I obersved during the contextual interview phase. 

##### In Matt's case: 
During my contextual interview I found that college students make decisions largely based on ease of use and price (with the expectation that a service be as close to free as possible). 

##### In Rebecca's case: 
From discussion in class I found that my other classmates working on the Sustainable Cities project found that more invested environmentalists were often interested in connecting with others with a similar mindset. 

Because of these two perceived needs I wanted the app to cater to both of their needs, with the seperation of 'hosts' and 'searchers'. With different expectations as to the commitment level of each of these users. Users like Rebecca would use the application more frequentlyt and invest more time in creating profile spaces, whereas users like Matt can casually scroll once or twice to find what they need and may only return if they want to become more involved in local/campus gardening and compost efforts.
