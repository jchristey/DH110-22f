#### Reflection

When creating these user personas I attempted to incorporate some motivations and mentalities I obersved during the contextual interview phase. 

##### In Matt's case: 
During my contextual interview I found that college students make decisions largely based on ease of use and price (with the expectation that a service be as close to free as possible). 

##### In Rebecca's case: 
From discussion in class I found that my other classmates working on the Sustainable Cities project found that more invested environmentalists were often interested in connecting with others with a similar mindset. 

Because of these two perceived needs I wanted the app to cater to both of their needs, with the seperation of 'hosts' and 'searchers'.
