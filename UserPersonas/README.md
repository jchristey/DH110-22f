### User Personas and Scenarios

These two user personas will inform the design of the app from two ends of the spectrum. We have Rebecca who is more involved in enviornmental activism, using the platform as a means of publicity for her existing garden as a 'host' on the platform. While novice, Matt, is simply looking for an easy solution as to where to put his food scraps, making him a 'searcher'. 

### Personas and Empathy Maps

Below our personas: Matt and Rebecca are shown with their demographic information, brief personal bios as well as their motivations, goals, and challenges.

### Reflection

When creating these user personas I attempted to incorporate some motivations and mentalities I obersved during the contextual interview phase. 

##### In Matt's case: 
During my contextual interview I found that college students make decisions largely based on ease of use and price (with the expectation that a service be as close to free as possible). 

##### In Rebecca's case: 
From discussion in class I found that my other classmates working on the Sustainable Cities project found that more invested environmentalists were often interested in connecting with others with a similar mindset. 

Because of these two perceived needs I wanted the app to cater to both of their needs, with the seperation of 'hosts' and 'searchers'. With different expectations as to the commitment level of each of these users. Users like Rebecca would use the application more frequentlyt and invest more time in creating profile spaces, whereas users like Matt can casually scroll once or twice to find what they need and may only return if they want to become more involved in local/campus gardening and compost efforts.
