### Low Fidelity Prototype

#### Brief Description

The role of the low fidelity prototype is to sketch out an idea of different app/website functionality before concerning yourself with too much of the visual aspect of the design. By troubleshooting this process with a user I was able to gain more perspective in terms of what is user-friendly functionality and what I needed to adjust. 

#### List of tasks 

For this project I outlined two tasks that a user may use the app to accomplish:

1 â€“ The first task is to find a local garden and send them a message. This will consists of quite a few interactions: making an account, using the search bar, selecting a garden, and finding the message function. 

2 - The second task is to create an account for a garden and post a blog post. This task would be done by a garden 'founder on the site' and includes making the account, navigating to the blog section, filling in the necessary information and posting.

#### Testing the tasks

#### Reflection

One thing that was challenging about user testing in the case of a low fidelity prototype was explaining the process to the participant. She hadn't participated in anything like this before and I think having to find the screen that would match a certain action she took wasn't exactly seamless.
