### Low Fidelity Prototype

#### Brief Description

The role of the low fidelity prototype is to sketch out an idea of different app/website functionality before concerning yourself with too much of the visual aspect of the design. By troubleshooting this process with a user I was able to gain more perspective in terms of what aspects were user-friendly and what I needed to adjust. 

#### List of tasks 

For this project I outlined two tasks that a user may use the app to accomplish:

1 – The first task is to find a local garden and send them a message. This will consists of quite a few interactions: making an account, using the search bar, selecting a garden, and finding the message function. 

2 - The second task is to create an account for a garden and post a blog post. This task would be done on the app by a garden 'founder' and includes making the account and garden profile, navigating to the blog section, filling in the necessary information and posting. 

#### The prototype overview

I decided to seperate the two tasks from one another as they would have the same initial landing page but the login and account creation sections would be seperate depending on the user, with 'founders' have more functions availible to them than someone who is simply a guest on the app. As to not confuse the my user (in the case of the user test of this prototype) I elected to seperate these two flows.

#### Reflection

One thing that was challenging about user testing in the case of a low fidelity prototype was explaining the process to the participant. She hadn't participated in anything like this before and I think having to find the screen that would match a certain action she took wasn't exactly seamless. Another issue I encountered in this step was that my user didn't necessarily know what was and wasn't clickable in my prototype and thus had to double-check what she could and couldn't access from a given page. 

Some notes that I plan on changing based on her feedback was: 

1 – I noticed that she preffered the 'browse' function over accessing the menu to find what she was looking for. Because of this, after the creation of an account, the user should be led to a welcome page as opposed to having to navigate to the menu in order to access other functions. This will improve clarity and give them more direct access to the sections of the app they desire to access. 

2 – There was also some initial confusion regarding the phrasing of the home page buttons: "Post a garden" and "Find a garden". This may need some reworking in terms of UX writing, so that users quickly know which area of the site applies to their situation.
