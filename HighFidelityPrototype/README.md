### High Fidelity Prototype

#### Brief Description

My projects aims to connect hopeful novice gardeners or composters to local gardens. As well as provide gardeners access to 
publicity and shared community through the app. The high fidelity prototype allows us to see the design in action by integrating interaction. In this way, the wireframe is fully fleshed out with interface design and the flow is in the hands of the user to navigate. 

#### Tasks

I've shown two specific tasks within this interactive prototype. 

1) The first task is to find a local garden and send them a message. 

The interactions included in this task are as follows:

- Login to an account / sign up for an account
- Browse and find a garden
- Find the message function
- Send message

This activity is one that would be done by a novice user in the case that they have a question regarding the garden's resources.

2) The second task is to create an account for a garden and post a blog post. 

The interactions included in this task are as follows:

- Login to an account / sign up for an account
- Navigate to the blog section
- Fill in the necessary information 
- Post

This task would be done on the app by a garden 'founder', probably one that has already visited 
the app and is fairly comfortable with its use. 

#### Wireflow

And a screenshot of the flow is attached below.

#### Interactive Prototype

The interactive prototype linked below supports both tasks outlined.

#### Cognitive Walkthrough 

We will be completing the cognitive walkthrough in class. 

#### Reflection

I ran through a few preliminary "cognitive walkthroughs" with my roommates but as they were in the earlier stages of the development of the high fidelity prototype and quite casual in nature I opted to leave them out. I did however opt to eliminate the 'back' function from the menu feature as having the app navigate the user back to a common page rather than the page you came from originally was quite disorientating so it seemed more straightforeward to have them be more in control of their navigation with the options listed below. I would have prefered the 'back' function navigate the user back to their last active page but I'm not sure how to do that or if it is possible within Figma's prototyping capabilities. I'll be sure to troubleshoot this in class during the cognitive walkthrough.
