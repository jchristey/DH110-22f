### High Fidelity Prototype



#### Brief Description

#### Tasks

I've shown two specific tasks within this interactive prototype. 

1 â€“ The first task is to find a local garden and send them a message. 

The interactions included in this task are as follows:

Sign up / make an account

Browse and find a garden

Find the message function

This activity is one that would be done by a novice user in the case that they have a question regarding the garden's resources.

2 - The second task is to create an account for a garden and post a blog post. 

The interactions included in this task are as follows:

Login to an account

Navigate to the blog section

Fill in the necessary information and posting

This task would be done on the app by a garden 'founder', probably one that has already visited 
the app and is fairly comfortable with its use.
