### Learning from people in context

#### Research Goal and Requirements 

For this project I'm curious as to the process of composting on campus. 
I narrowed down a student initiative on campus which encourages students to get involved in gardening; the initiative is called [DigUCLA](http://digucla.weebly.com/).
The garden located in Sunset Rec hosts weekly gardening workshops, welcomes gardeners of all experience levels and all the produce grown is donated to the CPO Food Closet.

#### Target User

Demographics: The target users in this scenario are college students. Perhaps most specifically those that are fairly new to the concept of compost and are looking to get involved and learn more. 

Preferences: Users care about the environment and the sustainability of their day to day activities. They may be inexperienced in composting or gardening but are aware that they "should do it" or vaguely aware of its benefits. 

Expertise: User do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application.

#### Research Methods and Plan

My initial plan was to attend one of DigUCLA's weekly garden workshops in order to observe how students interact with the garden and speak to both experienced and novice gardeners to learn about the opportunities at the garden, the work they do, and what draws them to do more.

Usually this organization has gardening and compost events on Sunday's from 12-2pm – however, when I went to the space it was closed with no one there. I still took this opportunity to look around and take some pictures of the physical space where students interact with the garden. 

I also messaged their instagram account in order to get in touch with one of the members of the organization to speak more about their process and approach to compost – however, this did not receive a response. 

Observation pictures are attached below for reference.
