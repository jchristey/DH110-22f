### Learning from people in context

#### Research Goal and Requirements 

For this project I'm curious as to the process of composting on campus. 
I narrowed down a student initiative on campus which encourages students to get involved in gardening; the initiative is called [DigUCLA](http://digucla.weebly.com/).
The garden located in Sunset Rec hosts weekly gardening workshops, welcomes gardeners of all experience levels and all the produce grown is donated to the CPO Food Closet.

#### Target User

Demographics: The target users in this scenario are college students. Perhaps most specifically those that are fairly new to the concept of compost and are looking to get involved and learn more. 

Preferences: Users care about the environment and the sustainability of their day to day activities. They may be inexperienced in composting or gardening but are aware that they "should do it" or vaguely aware of its benefits. 

Expertise: User do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application.

#### Research Methods and Plan

My initial plan was to attend one of DigUCLA's weekly garden workshops in order to observe how students interact with the garden and speak to both experienced and novice gardeners to learn about the opportunities at the garden, the work they do, and what draws them to do more.

Usually this organization has gardening and compost events on Sunday's from 12-2pm – however, when I went to the space it was closed with no one there. I still took this opportunity to look around and take some pictures of the physical space where students interact with the garden. 

I also messaged their instagram account in order to get in touch with one of the members of the organization to speak more about their process and approach to compost – however, this did not receive a response. 

Observation pictures are attached below for reference.

Because of this roadblock in my plan, I decided to conduct a contextual inquiry interview with my roommate, Amanda, about her experience composting. 

#### Research Materials

Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ny5gOdyWA5-hOb_4wRPG_QkUHHij_X00wCsUx_9TqQE/edit?usp=sharing) is the script used for my contextual inquiry interview.

And linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17AsJy5AZP5eTY3FpiSu9H5Kw8T9E1jC9?usp=sharing) is the recording of said interview and the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1govydJiMjOGCgZtZPPv3AeI5oSAhDZjv8xcZqZYr768/edit?usp=sharing) to the transcript. 

#### Reflection

There were a few noteworthy insights I got from this interview. The first was the apparence of what truly matters to this demographic (college students): *convenience* and *minimized cost*. These users generally care about the environment but may be low on time and low on funds. Because of this the product needs to have a high ease of use as if the convenience factor is not apparent these users may not go out of their way to change their habits. Additionally, if the service could be provided for free or at a greatly reduced price it would vastly raise the number of participants. 

From the background questions, I also discovered more in terms of the current reality of students in apartments in Westwood. While in dorms at UCLA students are encouraged to compost and recycle and the resources for them to do so are present (sectionned trash cans for recycling, compost, landfill) with information on what to put in each bin. However when students move to apartment buildings off campus they often aren't given the same resources to compost and are left asking what to do with their food scraps. 

It was also important to see how much this potential user valued compost in comparison with other acts of sustainability. While she considered herself to be an environmentalist quite foundationally (7/10), she rated compost as being a 5/10 in terms of importance to her. This will be important to consider in either transitionning away from the subject of compost to a sustainability issue closer to students' hearts or when designing our product to do so with this in consideration. In this way, another design problem to solve will be emphasizing the importance of the issue and essentially making people care.
