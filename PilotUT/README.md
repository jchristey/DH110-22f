### Pilot Usability Test

#### Introduction 

The ['I Recycle Smart' website](https://irecyclesmart.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwqJSaBhBUEiwAg5W9p3ZheoT1aTWHW3VpKZ5faokkwxH60RkugRHAhho0Qb1ZFEAs2VMxIxoC1pgQAvD_BwE) is a platform created as a part of the CalRecycle initiative by the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. It walks the user through best practices for recycling as well as outlining what someone can and can't recycle. The 'Local Recycling Information' page also gives the link to pages from the local department of sanitation of specific California cities so that the user can find the recycling information specific to their area. Additionally, the site hosues a 'Toolkit' page which contains educational and publicity related materials that users can share with their networks to further recycling education within the community. 

#### Pilot UT Goals

In general, the purpose of a usability test (UT) is to observe how users interact with a product and to gather their feedback in terms of its use. The goal of the UT is specifically to gage whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory in order to make necessary improvements to ameliorate the user experience. Because of its nature, in which the moderator observes the user naviagting the product and hears their thoughts aloud as they do so, UT is on of the best ways to understand the user's experience with the product. 

#### Methodology

I moderated this usability test with my roommate, Ellie, in the living room of our apartment. Zoom was used to record our audio and video as well as to record the screen as she moved through the tasks. 

First, I gave some initial information in terms of the study and gained her consent to participate. 

Then, in the pre-test questionnaire I measured her initial impressions of the website's ease of use and trustworthiness, based on a screenshot of the home page. 

I then observed her fulfill the following tasks: 

| Task # | Task Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Suppose that you are just starting to compost and are unsure of what you can and can't put in the compost bin. Use the 'I Recycle Smart' site to check if the grass clippings from your yard are recyclable |
| 2 | Suppose your friend is complaining about not knowing where to put her leftover paint after painting her home. *Step 1:* Find the portion of the website that mentions how to dispose of paint. *Step 2:* Find the nearest paint collection center near you|
| 3 | It seems that things are not so clear cut on what you can and can't recycle. Some items depend on what city you're currently in. *Step 1:* Use the site to locate the Los Angeles sanitation page. *Step 2:* Find out if you can recycle milk cartons in Los Angeles|

Following the completion of these tasks, I had the participant fill out the post-test questionnaire, recording her perception of the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction associated with the use of the website. 

After collecting some final demographic information, I thanked the participant and ended the recording.

#### Reflection 

I felt the usability test went well over all, with a few improvements noted for next time. First, the participant opted to give up on the first task because of perceived inability to find the relevant information. Though I prompted her to keep looking and steered her in the right direction when she approached areas of the site that were going to be touched in other tasks, I believe I could have encouraged her to continue looking and perhaps she could have completed the task. I feel she may have been rushing to find things and complete the task because of perceived "test-like" conditions. I could have better relaxed her and probed her to continue and complete the task. 

Additionally, the usability test and task completion was faster than expected. The assignment had outlined a desired timeframe within which the participant complete the given tasks. However, because of her desire to give up on completing the first task and the speed at which she completed the second the participant did not stick to this expected timeframe. 

Another thing that I found during this pilot usability test was that some tasks seemed to be easier to complete for the participant because of additional experience with the website as the user progressed through the tasks. I think some of the looking in the first task may have aided the participant in completing the second task quicker. I'd be interested in what effect changing the order of the tasks would have.

Finally, as my participant was filling out the post-test questionnaire I feel she was trying to answer the questions in terms of how the general population would rate the user experience of the website, instead of recording her own feelings and reactions. At times she cited that she had trouble in one area but that it might just be her. I think in this scenario I should have reassured her that we would like to record her experience with the site not what she perceived others would experience. 

Overall, I feel that this pilot usability test has made me more comfortable with the being professional yet friendly with participants so that they feel comfortable and supported while completing the tasks. Additionally, some small wording changes could be made to the survey (i.e. typo in demographic questions).
