### Interface Design

### Project Description
The purpose of this project is connect people searching for places to compost with local/campus compost gardens, so that both can easily find a solution to their issues and contribute to the establishment of a more sustainable community in the process. In doing so I've established wireframes and a wireflow for a few interactions someone may have with the app: setting up either a personal or garden account, locating a local garden, and sending a message. In this page we will delve deeper into the interface design of the app, specifically focusing on font, color, shape, layout and logo placement. 

### Digitized wireflow

Linked [here](https://www.figma.com/file/f2Urjg6UhsWW1nYqiuRrfu/Low-Fidelity-Prototype-(Copy)?t=N67ptB3BXJd7i2wc-1) is the digitized wireflow. 

### Graphical user interface design variation 

For this portion of the design process I've taken the 'login page' of the app as I believe it will set the tone for how the user will interact with the app as a whole. It is a portion of the site that both the novice user and the expert user would have to initially come into contact with, so it seems to be the perfect page to use as a basis for the interface design of the entire app. 

#### Design
![grid design](layout.png)

For this portion of the interface design process I used the row and column function of Figma to set up a grid within which to organize the essential elements of the login page. 

#### Color
![color variation](color.png)

Here I provided a few color variations both in blue and green tints. 

With the following colors for each color combination: 

##### Green

##### Blue

#### Typography

The following samples have the use the fonts: 

#1: Inter: which is good for online readibility as it was designed specifically for computer screens. 

#2: Open Sens: which is fairly neutral and approachable, with an upright style. 

#3: Roboto Condensed: a more geometric font, that still has some friendly curves. 

All of which have varied weights associated with them accross the interface based on where the text is and what it is being used to say. 

#### Shape

The following samples have buttons with varied 'roundedness'

#1: 20

#2: 5

#3: 0

#### Logo

The options above give variations of where the logo can be integrated into the interface design. 

### Impression test

Linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ok9FVkqj3L5891vNIX8O9tQquJb2ofZJ?usp=share_link) is the impression test. 

Based on the impression test, the more rounded button, the blue color scheme, the Roboto Condensed font, and the split background logo were the desired. Attached below (for the accessibility check) is the combination of these features for the final interface. 

### Accessibility check

Pictured above is one of the screenshots of the color contrast accessibility test done on Figma through the Plugin 'Color contrast'. I decided to feature the least glaring contrast to show that it still passes the WCAG AA test.
