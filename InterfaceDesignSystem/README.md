### Interface Design

### Project Description
The purpose of this project is connect people searching for places to compost with local/campus compost gardens, so that both can easily find a solution to their issues and contribute to the establishment of a more sustainable community in the process. In doing so I've established wireframes and a wireflow for a few interactions someone may have with the app. For this portion of the design process I've taken the 'login page' of the app as I believe it will set the tone for how the user will interact with the app as a whole. It is a portion of the site that both the novice user and the expert user would have to initially come into contact with, so it seems to be the perfect page to use as a basis for the interface design of the entire app. 

### Digitized wireflow

Linked [here](https://www.figma.com/file/f2Urjg6UhsWW1nYqiuRrfu/Low-Fidelity-Prototype-(Copy)?t=N67ptB3BXJd7i2wc-1) is the digitized wireflow. 

### Graphical user interface design variation 

#### Design

For this portion of the interface design process I used the row and column function of Figma to set up a grid within which to organize the essential elements of the login page. 

#### Color

### Impression test

Linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ok9FVkqj3L5891vNIX8O9tQquJb2ofZJ?usp=share_link) is the impression test. 

Based on the impression test, the more rounded button, the blue color scheme, the Roboto Condensed font, and the split background logo were the desired. Attached below (for the accessibility check) is the combination of these features for the final interface.
